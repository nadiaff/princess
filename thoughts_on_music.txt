Okay
I had some thought ideas >:3
It occurred to me that there is no particular necessity for us to have music made specific to our game
So one thing we could do is commission composers to make concept albums about princess and Noonye and such
8 bit chiptune albums
And they have more creative freedom
They will have to release them under Creative Commons Attribution license free for commercial use
So we can use them commercially
But so can anyone else
This isn't a disadvantage for us because actually, having the music featured in other things isn't a problem since what we are banking on is retro and nostalgia

And as long as the other things they're featured in are retro and nostalgic, which they presumably would be with 8 bit music, that only increases our value

Huh... if you commission it does that not mean you own the rights to it?
Penguin ?(?m°)? - Today at 7:00 AM
We'd commission it under the condition that it be released under a particular Creative Commons license
Our work is already referencing other things
So hearing the music in other things doesn't harm us
And if we work on other projects, we could use the music for that without any hassle
Plus it fosters good will among musical artists
And makes them more likely to promote our work
And then I was thinking part of it could also be that if we set up a store and allow people to download/donate we take a percentage from that
Like how Bandcamp allows you to pay as much as you like

References other things... what are we referencing and is it going to cause us problems.

Most of the content on the site is available for free
So for example there's a pong game
But I don't think the people who created pong will come after us for having a promotional game on the site for free that emulates pong
OrionNexus - Today at 7:04 AM
Nah I think the copyright on pong expired
Penguin ?(?m°)? - Today at 7:04 AM
Even if it didn't, people feature pong games promotionally fairly often
The Atari style games are the ones that are going to be the closest to their actual game counterparts
After that, it'll just be referencing game styles
No one's going to come after us for making a game in the style of Galaga or Centipede
Especially when it's free
OrionNexus - Today at 7:05 AM
True!
Penguin ?(?m°)? - Today at 7:05 AM
Now if we make something longer that involves a group of dedicated folks that we plan to sell, that's just going to be referencing tropes
All of the music on the page that I'm using now is royalty free for commercial use with attribution
So essentially, what I'm suggesting is essentially becoming a patron to composers to create more work like that
OrionNexus - Today at 7:06 AM
Good good! As long as we are all in the clear and we don't need to worry!
Penguin ?(?m°)? - Today at 7:07 AM
But it would be good for us because the most difficult thing on the web is getting your product out there to people
The money we make will be character merchandise
And also Patreon donations
Possibly community based advertising
Character merchandise is where the $$$ are at
We could use this same system to commission sprite sets from pixel artists and other people in the retro gaming community
Eventually, if we develop enough of a following with the stuff, then people will probably start coming to us to promote their work(edited)
The other advantage is like
Fuck if I know what I want in terms of music
Chances are the composers who have been invested in the 8 bit musical culture have a better idea of how to evoke the feeling that I'm going for than I do
But this way there's a variety to choose from rather than a specific track
